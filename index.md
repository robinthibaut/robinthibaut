## About

PhD student at Ghent University ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª. 

Iâ€™m currently working on Experimental Design in Earth Sciences using Machine Learning under a Bayesian approach.

## Latest paper

[A new workflow to incorporate prior information in minimum gradient support (MGS) inversion of electrical resistivity and induced polarization data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985121000331#f0005).

## Ask me about Python techniques for...
- Geophysical data processing and visualization, especially if it concerns Electrical Resistivity Tomography 
- Groundwater Modelling with Flopy
- Geostatistics
- 3D visualization with VTK
- Some of the techniques I often use:
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Canonical Correlation Analysis
  - Travelling Salesman Problem
  - Signed Distance
  - Gaussian Process Regression
  - Sequential Gaussian Simulation

Always looking to gain deeper knowledge about these fields and find new ideas on how to apply ML to Earth Sciences problems.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/robinthibaut/robinthibaut/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/robinthibaut/robinthibaut/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
