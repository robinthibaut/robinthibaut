Machine Learning | Experimental Design | Earth Sciences

### About

I am a PhD Fellow at Ghent University, Belgium. My research focuses on developing a new framework for experimental design in earth sciences under a Bayesian approach. I have experience in marine geophysical surveys, near-surface geophysics and coding. My research interests include Bayesian statistics, geostatistics, image processing, data science, and machine learning. I am interested in applying these methods to a variety of problems in environmental sciences and earth sciences.
