## About

PhD student at Ghent University ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª. 

Iâ€™m currently working on Experimental Design in Earth Sciences using Machine Learning under a Bayesian approach.

## Latest papers

**Preprint**: [A new framework for experimental design using Bayesian Evidential Learning: the case of wellhead protection area](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05539)

Official repository: [skbel](https://github.com/robinthibaut/skbel)

[A new workflow to incorporate prior information in minimum gradient support (MGS) inversion of electrical resistivity and induced polarization data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985121000331#f0005).

## Ask me about Python techniques for...
- Geophysical data processing and visualization, especially if it concerns Electrical Resistivity Tomography 
- Groundwater Modelling with Flopy
- Geostatistics
- 3D visualization with VTK
- Some of the techniques I often use:
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Canonical Correlation Analysis
  - Travelling Salesman Problem
  - Signed Distance
  - Gaussian Process Regression
  - Sequential Gaussian Simulation

Always looking to gain deeper knowledge about these fields and find new ideas on how to apply ML to Earth Sciences problems.
